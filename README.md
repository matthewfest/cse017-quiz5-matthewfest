# CSE 017 - Quiz 5

Due: 8/3 by end of day

Make one commit per question (at least).

## Question 1 

Consider the Depth First Search graph algorithm versus the Breadth First Search algorithm. They are very similar, except one uses a stack and the other uses a queue. How does the choice of datastructure in the affect the execution of the respective algorithms?

## Question 2

What is the difference between a tree and a graph?

## Question 3

In the circular queue datastructure we have `front` and `back` variables. What is their purpose? Why do we design the queue this way?

## Question 4

Encode the following graph as an adjacency matrix

## Question 5

For the graph in the previous question, write out the steps of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path between Node 1 and Node 11. For each step, write down the Unvisited set U, the Visited set V, and the current tenative distance vector D.
